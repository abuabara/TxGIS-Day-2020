Abstract: So you've been frustrated with GIS and have been wondering "There's got to be a better way." Turns out there is. R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by a large passionate community. R provides you an opportunity to automate and polish many of the GIS tasks, organize and crunch data quickly, while allowing you to make state-of-the-art statistical and geo-spatial analysis and data visualization. Join this session for an introduction to R-spatial, both using raster and vector data, mixing data from online resources and from scratch.
